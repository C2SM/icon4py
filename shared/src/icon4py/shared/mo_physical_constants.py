This module provides physical constants for the ICON general circulation models.

Physical constants are grouped as follows:
- Natural constants
- Molar weights
- Earth and Earth orbit constants
- Thermodynamic constants for the dry and moist atmosphere
- Constants used for the computation of lookup tables of the saturation
mixing ratio over liquid water (*c_les*) or ice(*c_ies*)
