Welcome to ICON4Py's documentation!
===================================

`ICON4Py <https://github.com/C2SM/icon4py>`_ is an ICON inspired code written in
Python and GT4Py. Documentation is currently at a very early stage of
development as the code is constantly evolving. However
numerical documentation for the dycore is available.

These pages are divided into two categories:
 - a *classical* software documentation, ideally suited for compact
   classes/methods/functions akin to any other software (e.g.
   |csDocExample|).
   This is automatically generated by sphinx using the docstring at the head of
   the method.
 - a new *scientific* documentation, tailored to long substeps of ICON4Py where
   it is useful to follow the flow of data and operations within the substep
   itself (e.g. |sciDocExample|).
   This is also automatically generated, but it works with a custom parser
   documented in |sciDocParser|; feedback is very welcome (see :doc:`feedback`).
