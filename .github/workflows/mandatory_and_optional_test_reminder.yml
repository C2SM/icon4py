            Please make sure you run these tests via comment before you merge!

            * `cscs-ci run default`

            **Optional Tests**

            To run benchmarks you can use:

            * `cscs-ci run benchmark-bencher`

            To run tests and benchmarks with the DaCe backend you can use:

            * `cscs-ci run dace`

            To run test levels ignored by the default test suite (mostly simple datatest for static fields computations) you can use:
             * `cscs-ci run extra`
