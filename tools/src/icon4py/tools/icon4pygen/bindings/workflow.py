class PyBindGen:
    """Class to handle the bindings generation workflow.

    The workflow consists of generating the following bindings for the ICON model.

    - A Fortran Interface (.f90), which declares a wrapper function which can be called from within the ICON source code.
    - A C interface (.cpp, .h) which enables passing Fortran pointers to the Gridtools stencil.

    Note:
        Within the C interface, we also carry out verification of the DSL output fields against the Fortran output fields.
        Furthermore, we also serialise data to .csv or .vtk files in case of verification failure.
