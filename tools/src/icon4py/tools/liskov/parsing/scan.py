        A directive must start with !$DSL <DIRECTIVE_NAME>( with the
        directive arguments delimited by a ;. The directive if on multiple
        lines must include a & at the end of the line. The directive
        must always be closed by a closing bracket ). A directive can be
        commented out by using a ! before the directive,
        for example, !!$DSL means the directive is disabled.

        Example:
            !$DSL IMPORTS()

            !$DSL START STENCIL(name=single; b=test)

            !$DSL START STENCIL(name=multi; &\n
