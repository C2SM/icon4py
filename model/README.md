# ICON4Py Model

This folder contains Python implementations for multiple ICON components.

It includes the following packages:

- `atmosphere/dycore`: Contains implementations of the dynamical core of the ICON model
- `atmosphere/diffusion`: Contains the implementation of diffusion in the ICON model
- `atmosphere/advection`: Contains implementations of the advection component of the ICON model
- `atmosphere/subgrid_scale_physics/microphysics`: Contains implementations of the microphysics and saturation adjustment components of the ICON model
- `common`: Contains shared functionality that is required by multiple components.
- `driver`: Contains the driving code for the model

## Installation instructions

Until the development reaches a stable state, we recommend you to follow the general instructions in the [../README.md](../README.md) root folder to install all model component and all its dependencies in a virtual environment for development.

**Note**: For more information specific to each component, please refer to the README in their respective subfolders.

### Testing

See the repository [README](../README.md) for general information.

#### Unit tests for stencils

The `gt4py` stencils in the `icon4py-model` packages are used for integration into Fortran code
via [icon4pygen](../tools/src/icon4py/icon4pygen). To make integration easier
unit tests for the stencils need to be placed into
a `stencil_tests` subfolder of the packages test path. For example

```
model/atmosphere/diffusion/tests/stencil_tests
model/atmosphere/dycore/tests/stencil_tests
model/atmosphere/advection/tests/stencil_tests
model/common/tests/tests/stencil_tests
```

#### Data dependent tests

Some tests depend on serialized data generated by a full model run.
Those tests are marked with `pytest.mark.datatest` and are only run when the `--datatest`
option is specified. Note that due to `pytest` configuration discovery
you need to specify the base package directory i.e. one that contains a `pyproject.toml` for the
commandline option to work.

```bash

pytest -v --datatest model/common
pytest -v --datatest model/atmosphere/diffusion
```

#### Testing parallel code

Icon4Py uses GHEX as communication library. It is an optional dependency of the model. In order to install and
run the parallel version do the following:

1. You need to have a MPI installation in your system, so do the following

```bash
sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev
```

or

```bash
sudo apt-get install mpich
```

On MacOS run

```bash
brew install mpich
```

2. Install optional python libraries:
   In the main folder of the repository, run

```bash
uv sync --extra distributed  # or `uv sync --extra all` which includes everything
```

Note that the current Python build for GHEX seems not to run on MacOS.

3. Run parallel tests
   In order to run the parallel tests you need to specify the `--with-mpi` option to `pytest`
   and _pass the exact folder location of the tests_ to `pytest`.

```bash
mpirun -np 4 pytest -v -s --with-mpi --datatest model/atmosphere/diffusion/diffusion_tests/mpi_tests/
mpirun -np 4 pytest -v -s --with-mpi --datatest model/common/tests/mpi_tests/
```
