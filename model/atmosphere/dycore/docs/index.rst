Welcome to ICON4Py's documentation!
===================================

ICON4Py is an ICON inspired code written in Python and GT4Py.
The documentation is currently at a very early stage of development, as the code
is constantly evolving, but you can take a look at the numerical documentation
for the dycore.

These pages present two categories of documentation:
 - a classical software documentation, ideally suited for compact
   classes/methods/functions akin to any other software you are used to (e.g.
   |csDocExample|).
   This is automatically generated by sphinx using the docstring at the head of
   the method.
 - a new *scientific* documentation, tailored to long substeps of ICON4Py where
   it is useful to follow the flow of data and operations within the substep
   itself (e.g. |sciDocExample|).
   This is also automatically generated, but it works with a custom parser
   documented in |sciDocParser|; feedback on this is very welcome.
