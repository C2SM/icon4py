Refinement control for ICON grid.

Grid refinement is used in the context of 
- local area grids to determine the type of a grid point,
- nested horizontal grids to determine the nested overlap regions for feedback
- domain decomposition to order grid points

See Zaengl et al. Grid Refinement in ICON v2.6.4 (Geosci. Model Dev., 15, 7153â€“7176, 202)
