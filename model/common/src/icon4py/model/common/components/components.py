    Protocol for model components.

    Components are the building blocks of the model.
    They operate on model state variables and transform them or produce new state variables.

    Each component should declare its inputs and outputs in terms of name, expected units and dimensions.

    Components are Callables upon __call__ that get passed a reference for the model state and
    select their needed inputs from there.

    Actual component definitions only need to implement this interface.

    Examples:

        >>> RequiredInputs: TypeAlias = Literal["foo", "bar"]
        >>> ProducedOutputs: TypeAlias = Literal["baz"]
        >>> class AlphaComponent(Component[RequiredInputs, ProducedOutputs]):
        ...     inputs_properties = {
        ...         "foo": {"standard_name": "Foo", "units": "m"},
        ...         "bar": {"standard_name": "BarBar", "units": "s"},
        ...     }
        ...
        ...     outputs_properties = {"baz": {"standard_name": "BAZ", "units": "s"}}
        ...
        ...     def __call__(
        ...         self, state: dict[RequiredInputs, model.DataField], time_step: datetime.datetime
        ...     ) -> dict[ProducedOutputs, model.DataField]:
        ...         ...


    TODO (@halungge): add more consistency checks.
     - check for mathching units and provide a hook for unit conversion for the components implementations
     - check for consistency of dimensions of state and input_properties

            and how they are applied to the model state? Should this be made explicit in the interface?
